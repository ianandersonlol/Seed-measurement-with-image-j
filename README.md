# Measuring seeds using Fiji and other distributions of imageJ

<ins>Required Materials:</ins>

1. A computer with Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
2. A camera or smartphone with a camera
3. A ruler
4. A stand or other apparatus able to hold camera at consistence distance (very important!)
5. A microscope (optional, but recommended)

1. The most important part of the image measuring process is collecting good, high quality images.
    1. Even lighting, a high contrast background, a clean workspace free of dust and other non-seed related plant parts are all highly recommended.
        1. Most importantly, having these factors consistent across all images is recommended.
        2. While almost any image can be measured, having variable lighting or contrast between different images will make batch processing difficult if not impossible.
2. Here are a few examples of well taken seed images. 

<img src="readme_images/GI_1.jpg" width = 300> <img src="readme_images/GI_2.jpg" width = 300> <img src="readme_images/GI_3.jpg" width = 300>

Note the even lighting and high contrast. 

3. Here are a few examples of poorly taken seed images.

<img src="readme_images/BI_1.jpg" width = 300> <img src="readme_images/BI_2.jpg" width = 300> <img src="readme_images/BI_3.jpg" width = 300>

Note the blurry image quality, poor lighting, and light bleed from a source light that is too bright.
