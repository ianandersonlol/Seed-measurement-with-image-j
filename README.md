# Measuring seeds using Fiji and other distributions of imageJ
By: Ian C. Anderson <iananderson@berkeley.edu> 

**<ins>Required Materials:</ins>**

1. A computer with Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
    1. The Python Operating system(Optional, largely unneccesary)  
2. A camera or smartphone with a camera
3. A ruler
4. A stand or other apparatus able to hold camera at consistence distance (very important!)
5. A microscope (optional, but recommended)
6. A copy of ImageJ, Fiji, or any other distribution of ImageJ 2.0 or above.

1. The most important part of the image measuring process is collecting good, high quality images.
    1. Even lighting, a high contrast background, a clean workspace free of dust and other non-seed related plant parts are all highly recommended.
        1. Most importantly, having these factors consistent across all images is recommended.
        2. While almost any image can be measured, having variable lighting or contrast between different images will make batch processing difficult if not impossible.
2. Here are a few examples of well taken seed images. 

<img src="readme_images/GI_1.jpg" width = 200> <img src="readme_images/GI_2.jpg" width = 200> <img src="readme_images/GI_3.jpg" width = 200>

Note the even lighting and high contrast. 

3. Here are a few examples of poorly taken seed images.

<img src="readme_images/BI_1.jpg" width = 200> <img src="readme_images/BI_2.png" width = 200> <img src="readme_images/BI_3.png" width = 200>

Note the blurry image quality, poor lighting, bad contrast and light bleed from a source light that is too bright

4. It is important while taking images to have a ruler for scale. 
    1. In a perfect world the height between your camera and the subject of your photos will never change. 
    2. We don't live in a perfect world. There will be variablity with how your image is scaled(In one image, a single pixel might be .01mm, while in another it might be .015mm.
    3. Having a ruler in every picture, or taking a picture of a ruler every few pictures is a great way to keep on track.
    4. We have found the sweet spot to be taking a picture of a ruler every 6 images. 
        1. This doubles as a great way to keep track of image IDs.
        2. On most smartphones it is incredibly time consuming to rename or tag images with any useful information. If the order of the seeds is known, it is trivial to rename images based on the order at which the images come in, and taking a picture of a ruler, with a the number in the list the next or last seed image taken was is a great way to help keep yourself on track!
    5. Here is an example of a good image of a ruler.
    <img src="readme_images/R1.jpg" width = 400> 
Note how the ruler is straight, the measuring incraments are easy to understand, and the order number is easy to read.
